# Experiment 17: Echo synthesiser with single echo

The goal of this experiment was to create an echo synthesiser that would play sound with an added echo a fixed number of milliseconds later. Clearly, to do this we needed to store sound samples for a certain period of time and play them back at a reduced volume together with the sound input.

### Storing sound in a buffer

We implemented the sound buffer using the FIFO provided by Quartus. This module receives a sound sample every clock tick, stores it in RAM, and passes it along by one block per clock tick, much like a shift register. Once this buffer fills up, one sound sample is written into it and one sample is read out of it every cycle, except with a delay of 820 ms since it was put in (there are 8192 entries in our FIFO, samples taken at 10kHz, `t = 8192/10,000 s`).
